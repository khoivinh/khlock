# Happyhour — Product Requirements Document

## Context

Happyhour (formerly Khlock) is a world clock and timezone converter web app (React/TypeScript/Tailwind, deployed on Cloudflare Pages at `happyhour.day`). Phases 1-2 (codebase cleanup, deployment, mobile UX fixes) are complete. The scroll-driven header animation is confirmed smooth. This PRD covers two tracks:

1. **Phase 3: UI Revisions + Cloud Sync** — revise clock tile interactions, hero clock, city menu, drag-and-drop, and add user accounts with cloud-synced preferences
2. **iOS Native App** — SwiftUI app with feature parity + home/lock screen widgets + cloud sync

**Status (2026-03-26):** Most Track 1 UI revisions are complete. Cloud sync (Clerk auth + Cloudflare Worker + D1) shipped 2026-03-25 using the Clerk dev instance (production instance requires a custom domain — see Backlog). Relative time offset feature and AM/PM sizing shipped 2026-03-26. Cross-device sync bug fixed 2026-03-26 — replaced union merge with cloud-wins strategy plus timestamp guard to prevent deleted zones from resurrecting on other devices. App rename voting form created via Google Forms. Several bug fixes and polish items remain before Track 1 is complete.

**Status (2026-04-20):** Full rebrand to Happyhour shipped — new domain `happyhour.day`, favicon, OpenGraph image, header logo, Happy Mode theme (rich yellow), production Clerk instance on `clerk.happyhour.day`. Five UX enhancements + five bug fixes also shipped (scroll-to-current-city on edit, shadcn Dialog for tile removal, removal fade animation, closest-city via browser geolocation, visibility/focus listeners for idle recovery, etc.). See `docs/2026-04-20-devlog.md`.

## Track 1: UI Revisions + Cloud Sync (Web)

### Goal
Revise the current UI — refine clock tile interactions, simplify the layout to grid-only, improve the Add Cities menu, and update the custom time reset flow. Add user accounts and cloud-synced preferences so clock configurations persist across devices.

### Scope: "Reset Time" Button (replaces "Show Live Time")
**Files:** `client/src/pages/world-clock.tsx`, `client/src/components/digital-clock.tsx`
**Figma:** [Hero Clock component (node 70:1954)](https://www.figma.com/design/ykzuXYZ4gnogbNKZeV3Q1H/Happyhour-Design?node-id=70-1954)

- [x] Remove the blue filled "Show Live Time" button from the sticky header
- [x] Add a "RESET TIME" text link in the hero clock's zone/temp row, right-aligned
  - Style: Inter SemiBold, 14px, uppercase, color `#4e82ee`
  - No icon — text only
  - Padding: 10px horizontal, 7px vertical
  - Visible only when in custom time mode
  - Present in both desktop and mobile hero variants

### Scope: Add Cities Menu Redesign
**Files:** `client/src/components/time-zone-converter.tsx`
**Figma:** [Add Time Zone section (node 36:3207)](https://www.figma.com/design/ykzuXYZ4gnogbNKZeV3Q1H/Happyhour-Design?node-id=36-3207)

- [x] Widen the Add Cities menu to span the full body column width (896px desktop, 327px mobile)
- [ ] Menu overlays clock tiles below (does not push content down) — *currently pushes content down*
- [x] On mobile, position the menu near the top of the viewport so the user can see as much of it as possible
- [x] Keep existing visual style: white background, `#e5e7eb` border, rounded 8px, shadow, search field with magnifying glass icon
- [x] When a searched city is already displayed, highlight it in the results list; tapping scrolls to and highlights the existing tile — *evolved from original "Already displayed" text approach*

### Scope: Remove List View Toggle
**Files:** `client/src/components/time-zone-converter.tsx`, `client/src/components/digital-clock.tsx`

- [x] Remove the grid/list view toggle buttons entirely
- [x] Remove the `layout` state and all list-view-related code
- [x] Grid view is now the only layout
- [x] Remove `verticalListSortingStrategy` import and usage

### Scope: Remove Meeting Planner Feature
**Files:** `client/src/components/digital-clock.tsx`, `client/src/components/meeting-planner-modal.tsx`, `client/src/components/time-zone-converter.tsx`

- [x] Remove the calendar icon from clock tiles
- [x] Remove the MeetingPlannerModal component and its import
- [x] Delete `client/src/components/meeting-planner-modal.tsx`
- [x] Remove `otherZoneKeys` prop threading from TimeZoneConverter and DigitalClock

### Scope: Next Day / Prev Day Badge
**Files:** `client/src/components/digital-clock.tsx`
**Figma:** [Tile Zone and Temp component (node 27:973)](https://www.figma.com/design/ykzuXYZ4gnogbNKZeV3Q1H/Happyhour-Design?node-id=27-973)

- [x] Add an inline badge next to the GMT offset when the displayed time falls on a different calendar day than the hero clock's time
  - "NEXT DAY" if the tile's date is ahead of the hero's date
  - "PREV DAY" if the tile's date is behind the hero's date
- [x] Badge specs:
  - Border: 1px solid `#6b7280`
  - Border radius: 3px
  - Padding: 5px horizontal
  - Text: Inter Bold, 7px, uppercase, color `#6b7280`
  - Gap between zone row items: 6px (instead of default 10px) when badge is present

### Scope: Drag-and-Drop Revisions
**Files:** `client/src/components/time-zone-converter.tsx`, `client/src/components/digital-clock.tsx`
**Figma:** [Desktop Drag Tile frame (node 4:2)](https://www.figma.com/design/ykzuXYZ4gnogbNKZeV3Q1H/Happyhour-Design?node-id=4-2), [Clock Tile states (node 17:2410)](https://www.figma.com/design/ykzuXYZ4gnogbNKZeV3Q1H/Happyhour-Design?node-id=17-2410)

- [x] Blue drop indicator always appears to the LEFT of the destination spot
  - Width: 4px, color: `#3c83f6`, border radius: 4px, full height of tile
- [x] Ghost tile (source position while dragging): 50% opacity
- [x] Drag overlay (tile following cursor): 90% opacity, yellow active background (`#fdf19d`), border 1px solid `#ffedbd`, shadow `0px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)`
- [x] Long-press to initiate drag on tile body (600ms delay, 5px movement tolerance); drag handle icon uses faster 150ms delay
- [ ] **Bug:** Touch drag unreliable on left-most column — pressing/holding sometimes doesn't trigger drag, or requires unnaturally long hold
- [ ] **Bug:** Drag overlay vertical spacing differs from resting tile — dragged tile should maintain identical sizing across all states

### Scope: Ellipsis Menu Replaces X Button
**Files:** `client/src/components/digital-clock.tsx`

- [x] Replace the X (close) button in each clock tile with an ellipsis icon enclosed in a circle (~17px)
- [x] Clicking/tapping the ellipsis opens a native browser `confirm()` dialog asking the user to confirm removal
- [x] If confirmed, remove the clock tile; if cancelled, do nothing

### Scope: Clock Tile Design Refinements
**Files:** `client/src/components/digital-clock.tsx`, `client/src/index.css`
**Figma:** [Clock Tile states (node 17:2410)](https://www.figma.com/design/ykzuXYZ4gnogbNKZeV3Q1H/Happyhour-Design?node-id=17-2410)

- [x] Tile states from Figma:
  - **Default:** white background
  - **Hover:** `#f0f0f0` background (desktop only, `@media(hover:hover)`)
  - **Focus (editing/dropdown open):** `#fdf7ca` background, 1px `#ffedbd` border
  - **Active (being dragged):** `#fdf19d` background, 1px `#ffedbd` border, shadow `0px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)`
- [x] Desktop tile layout: city name and time stacked vertically, 15px gap between city+time block and zone+temp row
- [x] Mobile tile layout: city name and time side-by-side (horizontal), 0px gap to zone+temp
- [x] Clock tile editing: single `type="time"` input with bordered edit UI matching Figma specs
- [x] Duplicate city guard: changing a tile's city to one already displayed swaps positions instead of creating duplicates
- [x] Max clocks: 16 (web)
- [ ] **Bug:** "New Delhi" city name wrapping again — let city name span full tile width (flow under time display) before truncating; maintain left alignment of city name, timezone, and temp rows (must not shift under drag handle icon)

### Scope: Sidebar Menu *(added post-PRD, implemented 2026-03-21)*
**Files:** `client/src/components/sidebar.tsx`, `client/src/pages/world-clock.tsx`
**Figma:** [Sidebar section (node 114:1302)](https://www.figma.com/design/ykzuXYZ4gnogbNKZeV3Q1H/Happyhour-Design?node-id=114-1302)

- [x] Sidebar slides in from the right, overlays the body
- [x] Contains: 24-hour clock toggle, east-to-west sort toggle, appearance mode (light/dark/system)
- [x] Full viewport height with ~28px padding top and bottom
- [x] Full viewport width on mobile
- [x] Smooth expand/collapse animation; no animation on initial page load
- [x] Drawer icon position stays consistent between open/closed states
- [x] Body scroll locked when sidebar is open
- [x] Account/login UI designed but intentionally non-functional (deferred to cloud sync phase)
- [ ] **Bug:** Login button text vertical alignment — text is 1-2px too close to the top
- [ ] Reduce sidebar height on mobile by ~20% — currently extends below fold when browser address bar is fully shown

### Scope: Cloud Sync & User Accounts *(shipped 2026-03-25)*
**Auth:** Clerk (Google + Apple social login via dev instance)
**Backend:** Cloudflare Workers + D1

- [x] Clerk modal login flow (Google + Apple)
- [x] Cloudflare Worker API: `GET/PUT /api/preferences`, `DELETE /api/account`
- [x] D1 schema: `user_preferences` table (user_id, zones, use_24h, sort_etw, theme, updated_at)
- [x] `useCloudSync` hook: fetch on sign-in, debounce-save on change
- [x] Cross-device sync: cloud-wins strategy with timestamp guard (replaced union merge that resurrected deleted zones)
- [x] Sidebar: user avatar + name when signed in, sign out button, sync status indicator
- [x] Graceful fallback: unauthenticated users use localStorage only

### Scope: User Name Display Redesign
**Files:** `client/src/components/sidebar.tsx`
**Figma:** [Sidebar user display (node 114:1557)](https://www.figma.com/design/ykzuXYZ4gnogbNKZeV3Q1H/Happyhour-Design?node-id=114-1557)

- [ ] Update signed-in user display in sidebar to match Figma component

### Scope: Relative Time Offset
**Files:** `client/src/components/digital-clock.tsx`, `client/src/components/sidebar.tsx`, `client/src/pages/world-clock.tsx`
**Figma:** [Tile with relative time (node 158:1840)](https://www.figma.com/design/ykzuXYZ4gnogbNKZeV3Q1H/Happyhour-Design?node-id=158-1840)

- [x] Add "Show Relative Time" toggle in sidebar (default OFF), synced to cloud
- [x] When enabled, display offset relative to hero zone in format "+1HR" or "-7HR" in the zone/temp row
- [x] Offset rendered inside a bordered badge; when combined with NEXT/PREV DAY, merged into a single unified badge with vertical divider (e.g. `+13HR | NEXT DAY`) — fixes wrapping bug on mobile
- [x] AM/PM meridiem indicators rendered at reduced font size for readability (hero: 36/48px, tiles: 16/24px)

### Out of Scope (Phase 3)
- Theme/color palette changes (current palette is close to final)

## Track 2: iOS Native App

### Goal
Build a native SwiftUI iOS app with full feature parity to the web app, plus home screen and Lock Screen widgets. Share user accounts and synced preferences with the web app.

### Core Features (Parity with Web)

1. **World Clock Display**
   - Hero clock showing local timezone with large digital time
   - Additional clocks grid (reorderable, grid layout only)
   - Live time with seconds display
   - Custom time mode (tap to edit, "Reset Time" text link to return to live)

2. **City Management**
   - Search and add cities (same 1500-city dataset from city-timezones)
   - Full-width search menu with "Already displayed" status for duplicate cities
   - Remove cities (ellipsis menu → confirmation)
   - Drag-to-reorder with left-side drop indicator
   - Max 16 clocks (matching web)
   - Cloud sync of city list and order via Clerk account (cross-platform with web)

3. **Weather Integration**
   - Temperature display per city via Open-Meteo API (free, no auth)
   - Color-coded temperature

4. **Day Indicator**
   - "Next Day" / "Prev Day" badge on tiles where displayed time is a different calendar day

5. **Appearance**

## Verification

### Web (Track 1)
- Visual inspection on Chrome mobile emulator (390x844 iPhone 14)
- Test both light and dark modes
- Verify grid layout at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
- Confirm drag-to-reorder: drop indicator always on LEFT, correct opacity for ghost (50%) and overlay (90%)
- Verify long-press drag works on tile body (600ms) and drag handle (150ms)
- Verify "Reset Time" text link appears in hero zone/temp row in custom time mode and resets correctly
- Verify Add Cities menu spans full body width, positions near top on mobile
- Verify already-displayed cities are highlighted in search results, tapping scrolls to tile
- Verify Next Day / Prev Day badges appear for clocks on different calendar days
- Verify ellipsis icon opens native confirm dialog and removes tile on confirmation
- Verify sidebar: opens/closes smoothly, toggles work, body scroll locked when open
- Verify duplicate city change swaps tiles instead of crashing
- Deploy to https://happyhour.day/ and test on real device

### iOS (Track 2)
- Run in Xcode Simulator (iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone SE)
- Test widget rendering in widget gallery
- Verify Open-Meteo API calls work on device
- Test drag-to-reorder with haptic feedback
- Test light/dark mode transitions
- Sign in with same account as web, verify same cities appear
- Test offline behavior (local changes sync when back online)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Batch A — Quick fixes
1. Login button text vertical alignment (1-2px CSS tweak)
2. New Delhi city name wrapping (span full tile width, maintain left alignment)
3. Sidebar mobile height (reduce ~20%)

### Batch B — Drag fixes
4. Drag overlay vertical spacing mismatch (match resting tile sizing)
5. Touch drag unreliable on left column (sensor tuning)

### Batch C — UI enhancements
6. Add Cities menu overlay (float over tiles, not push down)
7. User name display redesign (Figma node 114:1557)

### Then:
8. Begin Track 2 (iOS native app), using the finalized web app as the reference design

## App Rename

### Status
**Completed 2026-04-20** — renamed to **Happyhour**, live at `https://happyhour.day`. The voting poll below captures the pre-rename deliberation; see `docs/2026-04-20-devlog.md` and the related edit-spec for the execution narrative.

### Candidates (voting shortlist, historical)

| # | Name | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | **Goldenhour** | Evocative, warm. |
| 2 | **Tymely** | Readable misspelling, very ownable. |
| 3 | **Khlock** | Previous name. Personal, punny. |
| 4 | **Hi Time** | Friendlier, greeting-like. Two words. |

**Voting form:** [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFXrJK7ZmhkvJWb3JVxmoJP2Y5ZYrOqgwrDzH5VlxiLcvmFQ/viewform) — rated each name 1-5. Poll results captured in `docs/2026-03-27-naming-poll-results.md`.

### Eliminated candidates
- Goldnhour, Timly, Hightime — removed from shortlist 2026-03-26

### Changes Required (completed 2026-04-20)

- [x] Register domain — `happyhour.day` on Namecheap
- [ ] Rename GitHub repository — *pending (Phase B.1)*
- [x] Update `package.json` name field
- [x] Update heading text in `client/src/components/` (header renders brand wordmark + smiley logo)
- [x] Update Clerk app (production instance on `clerk.happyhour.day`)
- [ ] Rename Cloudflare Pages project — *not supported in-place; left as `khlock` since it's internal-only now*
- [x] Custom domain on Pages (`happyhour.day` + `www.happyhour.day` redirect)
- [x] Update Worker CORS allowed origins (`happyhour.day` added; `khlock.pages.dev` retained as transitional fallback)

---

## Backlog

- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts — add clock tiles, tab between clocks, edit custom time, etc.
- [ ] Sync `rel-time` (relative time offset toggle) to cloud — add column to D1 schema, include in API read/write, sync via `useCloudSync`
- [ ] Increase zone/temp font size on clock tiles for better readability
- [ ] Add copyright information and footer to the page

---

## Appendix A: How the Database Works

Happyhour stores user settings (which cities are added, 24h mode, theme, etc.) in two places that work together.

### The Two-Layer System

| Layer | Technology | Where it lives | Who can access it |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Local storage** | Browser localStorage | On the user's device, managed by the browser | Only that user, on that specific browser |
| **Cloud database** | Cloudflare D1 (SQLite on Cloudflare Workers) | On Cloudflare's servers | Only that user, after signing in |

### Local Storage (the default)

Every time a user adds a city, toggles 24h mode, or changes the theme, the app saves that immediately to the browser's local storage. This is what makes the app work without an account — no sign-in needed, no network required.

**Storage keys** (all prefixed `world-happyhour-`):

| Key | What it stores |
|-----|---------------|
| `zones` | JSON array of city keys (e.g. `["paris_FR", "newYork_US"]`) |
| `24h` | Whether 24-hour mode is on |
| `sort-etw` | Whether east-to-west sorting is on |
| `theme` | `"light"`, `"dark"`, or `"system"` |
| `rel-time` | Whether relative time offset badges are shown |
| `sync-snapshot` | Fingerprint of last synced state (for change detection) |
| `sync-at` | Timestamp of last successful cloud sync |

**Limitations:**
- Tied to one browser on one device — opening Happyhour on another device won't have these cities
- Cleared if the user clears browser data
- No backup or history

### Cloud Database (when signed in)

When the user signs in via Clerk, the app also syncs preferences to a Cloudflare D1 database. The entire cloud schema is a single table with one row per user:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  user_id    TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  zones      TEXT NOT NULL,       -- JSON array of city keys
  use_24h    INTEGER DEFAULT 0,   -- 0 = off, 1 = on
  sort_etw   INTEGER DEFAULT 0,   -- 0 = off, 1 = on
  theme      TEXT DEFAULT 'system',
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL        -- ISO 8601 timestamp
);
```

**API endpoints** (Cloudflare Worker at `/api/`):

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/preferences` | Fetch user's cloud preferences |
| `PUT` | `/api/preferences` | Save/update preferences (upsert) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/account` | Delete all user data |

All endpoints require a Clerk JWT bearer token. The Worker validates tokens against Clerk's JWKS endpoint.

### How Sync Works

The app uses a **local-first** approach:

1. **Every change saves to localStorage immediately** — the UI never waits for the cloud
2. **If signed in**, changes are also pushed to the cloud after a 1.5-second debounce (so rapid clicks don't flood the server)
3. **On sign-in from a new device**, cloud data is pulled and applied
4. **Conflict resolution:** timestamp-based, last-write-wins — if changes were made on two devices while offline, the most recent `updated_at` wins (no field-level merging)

The sync hook (`useCloudSync`) tracks state via the `sync-snapshot` fingerprint. When the fingerprint of current preferences differs from the stored snapshot, the hook knows local changes have occurred since the last sync.

### Limitations

| Limitation | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Max 16 cities | Enforced by both client and API |
| No history or undo | Only the latest state is stored |
| Last-write-wins | Conflicting edits from two devices resolve by timestamp, not merge |
| Single table | Cloud DB stores preferences only — no analytics or usage data |
| Clerk dependency | Cloud sync requires Clerk auth service to be configured |
| `rel-time` not synced | Relative time toggle is local-only (not in the D1 schema) |
